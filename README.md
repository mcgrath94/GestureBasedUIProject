# GestureBasedUIProject
Project for Gesture Based UI Module using Cortana

##Running the app
To run the app, you can download the zip folder or clone this repo to your desktop. You should then be able to open it in Visual Studio 2015 and run it on your device, provided you have Windows 10 on your PC. You will also need Cortana enabled to use the Voice Commands(currently the app only supports English UK, US, and CA).

##Purpose of the application:

To design a Universal Windows Application that could serve as a cookbook and which incorporates Cortana. The user will be able to use the 
app as a normal cookbook app but also will be able to use Cortana to activate the app. The user will have a number of different commands available 
to them which will help them find certain recipes and use the app. I believe this could be useful to the user as it would allow them to activate 
the app and find recipes when their hands are not free (i.e because they are cooking).

##Gestures identified as appropriate for this application:
The gesture used was voice - this I believe is the most suitable for such an application as it allows the user to continue cooking without 
having to pause and open the app. This is the main purpose of the application - to help the user by making their experience more efficient.

##What can you say to the app?
There are a number of different commands that can be used with the app, such as saying to Cortana;  
-Listen show me dinner recipes  
-Listen show me breakfast ideas  
-Listen show me easy/medium/hard recipes  
-Listen show about recipes app

A full list of the possible commands can be found in the VCD.xml file.

##Hardware used in creating the application:
For creating the application I used Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 10 and tested the app on my HP Laptop with Windows 10 as Cortana is 
built into Windows 10. Unfortunately I was unable to test the app on a Windows Phone or tablet.

##Conclusions & Recommendations:
After working on this project I learned a lot about implementing Cortana into UWP apps. At the beginning it was quite hard to use but as I moved through the project it became easier to understand how the app can incorporate Cortana functionality. I believe the use of Cortana and other similar interfaces(Siri, Google etc.) could greatly improve the users experience in applications such as this one and they will become more and more prominent in applications that could benefit from such a feature. Using Cortana to activate the app felt more natural and helpful than doing it normally.
I would like to continue to develop the app so that the user can ask Cortana to perform a wider range of tasks. I feel this app could be extended and also that similar app could incorporate this functionality to help its users.
